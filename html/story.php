            There was a hungry cat in the endless desert.<br>
            The cat alone walked and walked. But the cat had nothing to fear.<br>
            The cat met a big fierce lizard, a sly fox, and a dangerous owl. But they were all the cat dinners.<br>
            But as of today, the place doesn't even see a small animal.<br>
            I think the cat is about to collapse in the hot sun, can this cat survive?

            The cat came to mind and recalled his name given by his parents.<br>
            Mild Jack, which meant the most valiant cat.<br>
            Then, Jack began to see something in front of him. No, maybe it wasn't in vain.<br>
            As Jack raised his nose and smelled it, a seductive smell was a stab in Jack's nose.<br>
            "Ulala!"<br>
            cried Jack, finding the oasis. It sounded like a habit whenever Jack was in a good.<br>
            Jack immediately ran to the oasis and caught the fish frantically and pushed it into his mouth.<br>
            How much did Jack eat? Jack vomited all the fish and fell down as it was, feeling like he was in front of him were spinning again.

            Jack opened his eyes. Maybe because he slept soundly after a long time, Jack woke up stretching.<br>
            But somehow, Jack looked around and his eyes were wide open at the scenery he had never seen before.<br>
            The fish that was pleasing to Jack's tongue until earlier, and the oasis that was chattering, disappeared, and there were only high stone walls on all sides.<br>
            Jack seemed trapped in a dungeon-like space. At that moment, several red lights began to appear in the dark.<br>
            "Squeak, Squeak."<br>
            It's a big attack of rats aiming for Jack. Jack made a solemn resolution by drawing his sword out of his arms.

        <p>
            Jack strode along, tearing off a bloody sword in one hand and a mouse in the other.<br>
            Now, each wall was torched in the middle, so it was not dark, but the dungeon, which was still full of stone walls, gave off only a gloomy energy.<br>
            "Sniff."<br>
            Suddenly, a rotten smell poking Jack's nose comes out.<br>
            In front of Jack was walled up, and instead there was a manhole on the floor and a ladder down the sewer.<br>
            I guess this is the only way. Jack, who put a clothespin in his nose, slowly came down the ladder.

        <p>
            As Jack came down the sewer, screams began to be heard in the distance.<br>
            "Help me!"<br>
            Interested in the sound, Jack ran toward the sound.<br>
            When I got there, a little Lemur was surrounded by skull rats.<br>
            Oh, my God. Skull rat! Jack was not interested in the skeleton rats, who had no flesh on them,<br>
            but Jack could not resist the desperate gaze of the little Lemur.

            Jack, who defeated all the skeleton rats, decided to hear the whole story from Lemur.<br>
            "My name is Cognac. Animals just started turning into skeletons like rats, so I came to solve it!"<br>
            Jack asked why animals turn into skeletons.<br>
            "When animals eat contaminated food, they lose their minds and gradually become skeletons."<br>
            "I tracked down the source of the food and it came all the way here."<br>
            Jack thought of the fish he had eaten earlier.<br>
            Do I become a skeleton, too?<br>
            Jack decided to find the criminal right away and asked Cognac to guide him.<br>
            Cognac immediately accepted. The more colleagues, the better.

            Jack and Cognac are finally at the end of the dungeon.<br>
            As the two animals pushed open the large door, a large room appeared from inside, and in the room was a huge mouse in a cloak sitting in a chair.<br>
            Cognac shouted, "Are you the culprit who turned the animals into skeletons?" replied the great mouse, rising from his seat.<br>
            "My name is Rum. If you knock me down, I'll let you know what you want." Before long, Jack and Rum began to rush in with each other's weapons.<br>
            Now, can Jack find out why animals have changed and solve this mystery?
